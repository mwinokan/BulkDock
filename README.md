# BulkDock
ðŸ’ª BulkDock: Manage batches of Fragmenstein restrained protein-ligand docking jobs 

## Usage

Clone the repo on IRIS and change to directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:mwinokan/BulkDock
cd BulkDock
```

### Configure

Configure variables

```
python -m bulkdock configure
```

### Create directories

```
python -m bulkdock create-directories
```

### Setup target

First download a target zip archive from fragalysis and place in TARGETS directory.

Extract the target:

```
python -m bulkdock extract TARGET_NAME
```

Setup the HIPPO database **from within a valid SLURM job**:

```
python -m bulkdock setup TARGET_NAME
```

On IRIS this can be achieved with:

```
sb.sh --job-name "BULKDOCK_SETUP" /opt/xchem-fragalysis-2/maxwin/slurm/run_python.sh -m bulkdock setup TARGET_NAME
```

### Placements

Place a CSV in the INPUTS directory with the following structure:

|           smiles            | inspiration 1 | inspiration 2 |
|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1CCS(N)(=O)=O | A0487a        | A0719a        |

**The `smiles` column is required and must come first. The name of the other columns is not used, but values in those columns must refer to the observation shortcode of any inspiration hits for this compound**

The command that needs to run **from within a valid SLURM job** is:

```
python -m bulkdock place TARGET_NAME SDF_NAME
```

On IRIS this can be achieved with:

```
sb.sh --job-name "BULKDOCK_PLACE" /opt/xchem-fragalysis-2/maxwin/slurm/run_python.sh -m bulkdock place TARGET_NAME SDF_NAME
```

Once a placement job has finished the SDF output will be located in the OUTPUTS directory as configured.

### Fragalysis export

The SDF output can be modified for direct upload to the Fragalysis RHS with the `to-fragalysis` command. To see the options:

```
python -m bulkdock to-fragalysis --help
```

To avoid passing the same values for submitter_institution, submitter_name, submitter_email, and ref_url you can set the config variables:

```
python -m bulkdock configure FRAGALYSIS_EXPORT_SUBMITTER_NAME "Max Winokan"
python -m bulkdock configure FRAGALYSIS_EXPORT_SUBMITTER_EMAIL "max.winokan@diamond.ac.uk"
python -m bulkdock configure FRAGALYSIS_EXPORT_SUBMITTER_INSTITUTION "DLS"
python -m bulkdock configure FRAGALYSIS_EXPORT_REF_URL "https://github.com/mwinokan/BulkDock"
```

Then to check the configuration:

```
python -m bulkdock to-fragalysis TARGET SDF_FILE METHOD_NAME
```

Once happy, submit the job (or run the above from within a notebook):

```
sb.sh --job-name "BULKDOCK_EXPORT" /opt/xchem-fragalysis-2/maxwin/slurm/run_python.sh -m bulkdock to-fragalysis TARGET SDF_FILE METHOD_NAME
```
